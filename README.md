# Secu-AI: AI-Powered Cybersecurity Assistant (Interactive Terminal)

Secu-AI is an open-source, AI-powered cybersecurity assistant that provides an interactive terminal interface for users to query and analyze threat intelligence data. By leveraging the power of AI and integrating with popular cybersecurity tools and services, Secu-AI offers a user-friendly platform for threat intelligence, analysis, and response.

## Features

### üîç **Threat Intelligence and Analysis**

- **VirusTotal Lookup**: Perform real-time VirusTotal lookups to check the reputation of files, URLs, domains, and IP addresses. Secu-AI integrates with the VirusTotal API to provide up-to-date and accurate threat intelligence data.
#### **Future Feature for Threat Intelligence**
- **AlienVault OTX Integration**: Correlate threat intelligence data with AlienVault's Open Threat Exchange (OTX) to gain insights into global threat activity and identify potential threats targeting your organization.
- **Whois Lookup**: Perform WhoIs lookups to gather information about the ownership and registration details of domains and IP addresses, helping you to identify suspicious or malicious activity.
- **Phishing Analysis**: Analyze URLs and emails to detect phishing attempts and other social engineering attacks. Secu-AI uses machine learning algorithms and AI models to identify and classify potential phishing threats.
- **Log Correlation**: Analyze and correlate logs from various security tools and systems to identify patterns, anomalies, and potential threats that may have been missed by individual tools.
### üí° **AI-Driven Insights and Recommendations**

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Secu-AI uses advanced NLP techniques to understand and interpret user queries, providing relevant and accurate responses to cybersecurity-related questions.
- **AI Model Integration**: Integrate custom AI models and machine learning algorithms to extend the capabilities of Secu-AI and tailor it to your organization's specific needs.

## Installation

1. **Install Secu-AI using pip**:

   ```bash
   pip install https://github.com/GNishanSingh/Secu-AI/releases/download/Secu-AI_1.0/SecuAI-1.0-py3-none-any.whl
   ```
2. **Configure your Mistral AI API token**: Set the `MISTRAL_API_KEY` environment variable to your Mistral AI API token. You can do this by adding the following line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

   ```bash
   export MistralToken=your_mistral_ai_api_token_here
   ```
3. **Set the VirusTotal API key**: Open your shell's configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc) and add the following line, replacing <your_virustotal_api_key> with your actual API key:
    ```bash
    export VirusTotal_Token=<your_virustotal_api_key>
    ```
4. **Verify the installation**: Run the following command to verify that Secu-AI is installed correctly:
   ```bash
   secu-ai
   ```

   This should start the interactive CLI for Secu-AI.

## Usage

Secu-AI provides an interactive terminal interface for users to query and analyze threat intelligence data. To get started, simply run the following command:
```bash
secu-ai
```

You will be presented with a prompt to enter your query. Here are some examples of how to use Secu-AI:

- **VirusTotal Lookup**: Enter `virustotal <target> [file|url|domain|ip]` followed by the file path, URL, domain, or IP address you want to look up. For example:

  ```
  check what does virustotal says about <your IOC (ip, url, hash, etc)>
  ```

Secu-AI will provide relevant and accurate responses based on your input, allowing you to quickly and easily query threat intelligence data and gain insights into potential threats.
